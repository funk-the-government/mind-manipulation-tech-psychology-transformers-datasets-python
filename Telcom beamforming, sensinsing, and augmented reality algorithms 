## Telecommunications Algorithms and Formulas Used 

### Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT)

### Cognitive Dual-Functional Radar-Communication (CDFRC): 
These systems use a closed-loop feedback mechanism, powered by AI, to sense targets and adaptively design waveforms. This allows the system to design dynamic beampatterns based on real-time feedback, optimizing the multi-user interference and detection probabilities. 

### CONCORD (Constrained Communications and Radar Dual-Use):
 A technique developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory, CONCORD creates a library ("alphabet") of waveforms that can serve both communication and radar functions, allowing systems to dynamically switch based on application needs.
 
### Constructive Interference (CI)-Based Waveforms: 
This method designs a joint radar-communication waveform to maximize communication symbol-related constructive interference. By doing so, it can improve communication performance without sacrificing radar performance. It has been shown to outperform conventional methods in terms of bit error rate.

### Symbol-Level Precoding (SLP): 
This technique leverages the spatial and temporal degrees of freedom in a massive MIMO system to jointly enhance communication and radar sensing capabilities. The challenge is the high computational complexity, which researchers are addressing using deep learning approaches. 

### Orthogonal Time-Frequency Space (OTFS):
 Unlike OFDM, which is susceptible to Doppler effects, OTFS modulation is inherently robust to high mobility. This makes it a strong candidate for ISAC systems in dynamic environments, such as autonomous vehicles. Cutting-edge research involves jointly designing dual-functional OTFS signals and receiver filters to suppress interference.
 
### Code-Domain Index Modulation (CDIM):
 This technique can enhance communication rates and has been combined with radar waveforms. A recent covert dual-function radar-communication waveform uses phase-reduced shift keying and CDIM to embed information into linear frequency modulation (LFM) signals, improving communication rate while remaining covert. 

### spatial-variant (SV) Doppler
Accurate range model with acceleration, the coupling phase terms, and spatial-variant (SV) Doppler parameters are the main issues to be solved in

### high-speed-high-squint SAR (HSHS-SAR) with a curved trajectory.

 phase correction approach is derived to eliminate the azimuth dependence of Doppler parameters. Finally, in order to **avoid zeros-padding operation**, the proposed method focuses on the **sub-aperture data in the range time and azimuth frequency domain through data aligning processing**. The experimental results of both simulation and real data verify the effectiveness of the proposed method

###  Massive MIMO Formulas for Biodetection and Tracking at 28GHz

### floSAR Formulas for Biodetection and Tracking at 28GHz
Forward-Looking SAR (floSAR) extends traditional SAR for forward imaging along flight paths, adaptable to 28GHz drones/vehicles for biodetection in dynamic environments (e.g., tracking moving biological targets). While specific formulas are sparse, core principles align with SAR:

### **General floSAR Geometry Resolution** (adapted for mmWave):
  Resolution δ_az ≈ λ R / (2 L) ≈ 0.0107 R / (2 L) m at 28GHz, where R is range, L is synthetic aperture length. For biodetection, multichannel beamforming suppresses ambiguities, enabling 3D forward-looking bio-imaging with sparsity-driven enhancement.

### **Dispersion Relation in Array Approach** 
(for 3D floSAR tracking):
  Similar to SAR: 4k² = k_x² + k_y² + k_z² with k ≈ 586 rad/m, supporting unambiguous 2D/3D images for bio-target localization (e.g., human presence ahead).
  
### diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
 the term **"kurtosis anisotropy (KA)"** is a metric used to quantify the properties of water diffusion in the brain's white matter. 
 
### Total Variation (TV) Minimization:
A method using algorithms like Split Bregman deconvolution can reduce ringing while also sharpening the image and preserving its information content. 

### Multiframe Super-Resolution:
This approach uses multiple noisy images to improve the final reconstructed resolution and is robust against noise in both the image and the **point spread function (PSF).** 

### Sparse Optimization and Compressed Sensing:
These modern computational approaches enable efficient solutions for complex image reconstruction problems. 

### Blind Deconvolution:
In some mmWave scenarios, the imaging system's response (PSF) might be unknown. Blind deconvolution methods aim to estimate and correct for this unknown response while also restoring the image. 

### Autofocusing as a Sparse Deconvolution Problem:
In applications like **3D Forward-Looking Synthetic Aperture Radar (FLoSAR)** autofocusing can be framed as a sparse deconvolution problem to correct for motion errors and improve image quality, according to this IEEE Xplore document.
