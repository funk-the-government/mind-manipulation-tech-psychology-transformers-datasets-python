## ABSTRACT SELF AWARE
## SELF ADAPTING

## RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):
Pattern memory: Store and retrieve antenna processing patternsContextual similarity: Match current sparse SAR data to historical patternsKnowledge transfer: Leverage past processing experiences for new data
## Leaky SNN (Spiking Neural Networks):
Biological realism: Membrane potentials, spike thresholds, refractory periodsTemporal dynamics: Perfect for time-series antenna data processingEnergy efficiency: Only process when neurons "spike" - sparse computationPersistent state: Membrane potentials carry information between frames
## Pyramidal Feedback Memory:
Hierarchical patterns: Build knowledge hierarchies like cortical columnsTop-down modulation: High-level patterns influence low-level processingContextual boosting: Related patterns enhance current processing
## Auto-Generating Kafka Consumers:
Self-organizing: Automatically spawn consumers based on data patternsLoad balancing: Scale consumers up/down based on processing load Pattern specialization: Create dedicated processors for frequent pattern types

## End-to-End Learning: 
This approach uses deep neural networks to design the transmitter and receiver functions, including the waveform itself. The network is trained on data to jointly optimize communication and sensing metrics, enabling the system to learn the best possible waveforms for specific environments.
